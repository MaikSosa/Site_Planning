                    <h2>Main Fork Salmon River, Weast Idaho</h2>
                    <div id="river1-paragraph">
                        <p> Rich in scenic wonders and history, the Main Salmon River drops 1,200 feet in 89 miles, creating some exciting memories along the way. The blue-green waters, known as the "River of No Return,"
                            warm up to very comfortable temperatures in July and August. Calm sections and deep pools perfect for relaxing, swimming, and simply absorbing the country's splendor
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You'll enjoy sandy camping beaches backed up to pine forests and granite mountains. Here, wildlife abounds and rock paintings left by ancient inhabitants still exist. 
                            Homestead cabins dot the riverway, and some are still occupied today, made accessible by private jetboat and/or private plane.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV. The Salmon is one of the longest undammed rivers in the United States. As a free flowing river the water is higher, faster, and colder in the early summer and lower, slower, and warmer in the late summer. 
                            There are good rapids all summer...but families with children who like to swim tend to appreciate the late summer's slower, warmer water more.

                    <h2>Payette River, Southwest Idaho</h2>
                    <div id="river2-paragraph">
                        <p>
                            The Main Payette River is a classic Idaho whitewater river with plenty of pool and drop rapids ranging from Class II to Class III. 
                        </p>
                
                        <p>
                            The put-in at Banks, ideally situated at the confluence of the North and South forks of the Payette, is the hub of river running in the area. This Class III stretch is ideal for novices and intermediates. 
                            The drops are generally easy to negotiate, straightforward and the surfing can be excellent.
                        </p>
                    
                        <p>
                            The Payette River is an 82.7-mile-long (133.1 km) river in southwestern Idaho and is a major tributary of the Snake River. Its headwaters originate in the Sawtooth and Salmon River Mountains at elevations over 10,000 feet (3,000 m).

                    <h2>Selway River, North Idaho </h2>
                    <div id="river3-paragraph">
                        <p>
                            The Selway River is a large tributary of the Middle Fork of the Clearwater River in the U.S. state of Idaho. It flows within the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness, the Bitterroot National Forest, and the Nez Perce National Forest of North Central Idaho.
                            The entire length of the Selway was included by the United States Congress in 1968 as part of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers Act.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            A fun collection of mostly class III rapids starts your trip off with a bang, including Slalom Slide (III), Galloping Gertie (III+), Washer Woman (III+), Cougar Bluff (III) and Holy Smokes (II+/III-). 
                            Goat Creek Rapid (III/IV) is a jumble of large boulders that may require some tight maneuvering.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            The Selway is one of the premier wilderness multi-day trips in the West. Boaters typically spend four to six days floating the 47 miles through the heart of the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness Area. 
                            The Selway has the best of everything: fun, technically challenging class IV whitewater, spectacular Idaho wilderness scenery, beautiful campsites, and best of all, almost no people.
                        </p>
