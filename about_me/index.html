    <p style="text-align:center;">I am originally from Mexico City. I love traveling, and some
        countries I have visited are Canada, USA and Guatemala. If you 
        are thinking that I like soccer, that is a correct assumption. 
        <br>I am surprisingly good at Shooter games, and spent some time playing Valorant. 
        Lately I have been doing photography as a hobby.
        My favourite band is Coldplay.</br>

    <p style="text-align:center;">Not so long ago I changed my major from Computer Engineering
        to CIT. I would love to work in the cybersecurity industry and 
        have the opportunity to live in another country. 
        <br>I am stoked to be studying this semester and being able to meet you all.
        Specially because last year was rough for me in multiple areas of my life.</br>
